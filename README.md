# dsw-project

How do we collaborate:
- Version control with Jupyter Notebook is very messy. So, we try to keep only one ipynb file. Put all the feature engineering work into py files and wrap in a function/ class. Import the class/ function from py file in the ipynb. 

- Branch out with "feature-xxx" when we work on the feature. Create PR to main branch.
